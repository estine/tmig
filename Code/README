Usage instructions:

1. Run "java TMIG <input_midi_file> <input_chord_file> <order>"
(Note that the input midi file and chord file must match exactly, in terms of length, or errors will occur)
2. From there you will be prompted to input more files, or press 'n' to not have any more input
3. Then you are prompted to enter an output chord list (the generated improvisation will use these chords)
4. And finally, an output MIDI file location (make sure to add ".mid" as file ext.)
5. The program will generate the MIDI file, and will prompt you if you'd like to generate more (each will be uniquely named)

An example run of the program:

% java TMIG ../Lazy_Bird_3_Choruses.mid ../Lazy_Bird_Chords 3
Parsed 607 input notes, BPM detected as 252.
More MIDI/chord list training data ('n' to stop)?: n                    

Chord list to generate improv. with: ../Lazy_Bird_Chords_Output
Output MIDI file location: Lazy_Bird_Gen.mid
                                                                   
Generated improvisation of 494 notes with BPM 252.
